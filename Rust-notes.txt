Rust don't have garbage collector - no need to worry about memory allocation and de allocation

No need of reference

cargo is a package manager in Rust


rustc <file-name> creates an executable file

./<executable-file-name> to run from cli

cargo init -- creates a rust_sandbox / devspace

creates a src/main.rs and traget along with cargo.toml
toml is similiar to what we see as package.json in nodejs


cargo init rust_dev

cargo run
afterwards
we can also run ./target/debug/rust_dev 

cargo build

and 

cargo build --release for production

Task 1 :
Create a function in print.rs and Run it in main.rs 


variables are immutables by default.
