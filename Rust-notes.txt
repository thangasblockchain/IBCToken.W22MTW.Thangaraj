Rust don't have garbage collector - no need to worry about memory allocation and de allocation

No need of reference

cargo is a package manager in Rust


rustc <file-name> creates an executable file

./<executable-file-name> to run from cli

cargo init -- creates a rust_sandbox / devspace

creates a src/main.rs and traget along with cargo.toml
toml is similiar to what we see as package.json in nodejs
