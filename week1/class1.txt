class 1 - 11-7-2022

we use unsigned int among the primitive data types - scalar in cosmwasm rust.
signed integers allow negative values.

compound types -
arrays and tuples
Rust can infer from context.

cosmwasm types -
Uint64,Uint128,Uint256,Uint512
Decimal,Decimal256 (instead of float, use decimal)
for types larger than 64, should use cosmwasm types. bcoz they have better composability with jsonschema.
